Hey there! We're excited to have you staying with us soon. Here's some instructions on how to get in.

Our address is 35 Beideman St, San Francisco. To get here from the airport, you have a couple of options:
1. Uber/Lyft - $15-20 (if you use UberPool or Lyft Line), 20 minutes without traffic
  - if you don't have lyft or uber. Sign up with this code to get $20 (Uber - 3AZLL) (Lyft - NATHAN864737)
2. Taxi - $45, takes about 15 minutes without traffic

There is a big black padlock hanging from the door. The code is 0415. Please let yourself in, put the key back in the lock box. And then lock the door once you are inside.

Your bed number is in your reservation and so please match that up with your reservation. (If you don't have a number in your reservation, let me know upon arrival and we will get you set up -- it's a new system)

Fresh sheets and towels are by the bathroom. Feel free to ask if you need any help or recommendations. If you need anything else, the whiteboard in the kitchen has my contact info!

Smokers - Unfortunately, the neighbors complain so if you could go around the corner to the park that would be awesome.

<3, Nathan!
