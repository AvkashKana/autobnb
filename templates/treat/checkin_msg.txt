Hey there! We're excited to have you staying with us soon. Here's some instructions on how to get in.

Our address is 780 Treat Avenue, San Francisco. To get here from the airport, you have a couple of options:
1. BART Train - $9, takes about 45min with a 15min walk from the 24th St BART station
2. Taxi - $45, takes about 15 minutes without traffic
3. Uber/Lyft - $15-20 (if you use UberPool or Lyft Line), 20 minutes without traffic

There is a black lockbox attached to the left of the gate handle (next to the white doorbell). 

TO OPEN THE LOCKBOX
1. play the Mission Impossible theme song, or hum it to yourself
1. Pull to open the front panel and reveal the number pad. 
2. The code is "069*". push those buttons. you got this.
3. Grab a pair of keys for yourself, 
4. Enter the code again and close the box!
5. If there is only one pair of keys in the box, we ask that you leave them there so other guests checking in can enter.
 
If you're in bunk bed 1 through 4, your room is in the house past the kitchen and living room to the left. If you're in bunk bed 5 through 8, your room is the first door on the right once you enter. (Your bed number is in your reservation: Bunk Bed 3/8, Bunk Bed 7/8, etc)

Fresh sheets and towels are by the glowing tank in the living room. Feel free to ask if you need any help or recommendations. If you need anything else, the whiteboard in the kitchen has our contact info!
