Hey there! We're excited to have you staying with us soon. Here's some instructions on how to get in.

Our address is 780 Treat Avenue, San Francisco. To get here from the airport, you have a couple of options:
1. BART Train - $9, takes about 45min with a 15min walk from the 24th St BART station
2. Taxi - $40, takes about 15 minutes without traffic
3. Uber/Lyft - $15-20 (if you use UberPool or Lyft Line), 20 minutes without traffic

There is a lockbox attached to the left of the gate handle (next to the white doorbell). The code is 0780. Grab a pair of keys and let yourself in (one key is for the gate and one key is for the front door to the right).

If you're in bunk bed 1 through 4, your room is in the house past the kitchen and living room to the left. If you're in bunk bed 5 through 8, your room is the first door on the right once you enter.

Fresh sheets and towels are by the glowing tank in the living room. If you need anything else, the whiteboard in the kitchen has our contact info!

<3, Christian & Michelle.
